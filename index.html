<p>Hey, I'm Aishwarya, a fresher in computer science engineering at the college of engineering Thalassery,as far as my interests are concerned, Iâ€™m passionate about technology, love to learn new things, and enjoy challenging myself.</p>

<h3>Vision</h3>
<p>I am a curious person, I pursue things based on what sparks my interests and I believe this curiosity in me leads to more innovation and positive changes. Being a compassionate learner I aspire to realize my full potential and be an inspiration for many.
<h3>Mission</h3>
<p>My mission is to develop appropriate life skills and mold myself to become a successful professional and active individual.I am interested in learning Python and I consider 'She hacks' as a golden opportunity to improve my knowledge in Python. I believe communities like TinkerHub can help me achieve my goals in a fun and positive way.
